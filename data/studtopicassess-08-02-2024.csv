""" For many people, exercise has become a joke and a subject for New Year Resolution. I have many friends who make resolutions to exercise regularly from the first of January, almost every year. Yes, almost every year. Because they never continue to exercise after the first week or the first fortnight, jokes apart. Another exercise is the only way to keep our body and mind fit and healthy. Try doing some light exercises regularly for at least one month and experience a difference. Exercising doesn't mean heavy weight lifting or pumping the iron in a gym. Those things are for bodybuilders. To keep ourself fit, we can make a list of exercises which can be done in the backyard of our house without using any equipment.

Using a wooden spoon, mix it well. So keep this cow out for a few minutes. Don't let the dough cool down completely. It will turn dry. It has to be slightly warm and using your clean hand, knead it well for at least 3-4 minutes. So here is the perfect patrilles dough. After making the dough, we can make the patrilles right away.
